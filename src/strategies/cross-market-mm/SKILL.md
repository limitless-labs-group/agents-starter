# Cross-market MM — cross-venue market-making skill

Quote the **same** prediction market on two venues at once: mirror Polymarket's
live orderbook onto **Limitless** as resting BUY quotes, and hedge any fill
straight back on **Polymarket** so net delta stays ~flat. You earn the spread
between the venues (plus any Limitless maker rebate), not a directional bet.

This file is the canonical operating manual. Any agent with shell access and
this file can take it from clone → live → flat. For the fast onboarding path
(install → fund → setup → run live → close), see **[QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)**.

> [!WARNING]
> **Moves real money on two chains** (Base + Polygon). This is a reference
> implementation, not production trading infrastructure. **Use a dedicated
> wallet**, keep `order_size` small, and always start with `DRY_RUN=true`.
> Profitability depends on fill rate and the Limitless reward programs, not on
> the bot alone — read "Economics" (§9) before expecting profit.

## 1. How it works

```
                      ┌────────────────────┐
   Polymarket WS ───▶ │  core/polymarket/  │  best bid/ask per slug → QuoteFeed
                      │  ws.ts             │  (everything in YES-frame)
                      └─────────┬──────────┘
                                │ updates wake the cross-market-mm

              └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                │ a Limitless taker fills a quote

              ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

              │   • read net exposure on BOTH venues / 5s   │
              │   • if |net| > threshold:                   │
              │       FAK BUY the offsetting side on Poly   │
              └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Limitless is the maker side (where the spread is captured); Polymarket is the
hedge side (where directional risk is flattened, and where every hedge is a FAK
taker order that also generates Polymarket volume).

---

## 2. The wallet model — read this first

Everything is controlled by **one private key** (`PRIVATE_KEY`, your dedicated
EOA). That one key signs on both chains, but funds and identities live in a few
places. This is the single biggest source of setup confusion, so map it before
funding anything.

| Identity | What it is | Chain | Holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EOA** (your `PRIVATE_KEY`) | the key you control directly | Base + Polygon | Base USDC + ETH (Limitless side); signs everything |
| **Limitless** | trades from the EOA directly (EIP-712) | Base | — (uses the EOA's USDC) |
| **Polymarket deposit wallet** | a key-less ERC-1271 proxy derived from your EOA | Polygon | **pUSD** (the hedge collateral) |

Key facts that trip people up:

- **The Polymarket deposit wallet is key-less.** It's a deterministic CREATE2
  proxy (`POLY_1271`, signature type 3) whose only authorized signer is your
  EOA. You never get a separate private key for it — your `PRIVATE_KEY` controls
  it via ERC-1271 signature validation. `npm run cross-market-mm:setup-poly` derives
  and deploys it.
- **pUSD must live IN the deposit wallet.** Polymarket's CLOB v2 settles in
  **pUSD**, and your CLOB buying power is the pUSD balance *of the deposit
  wallet specifically*. pUSD sitting in your EOA, your Safe, or your Polymarket
  UI login address is **not** buying power. Fund the deposit wallet via the
  bridge (§4.3, `cross-market-mm:deposit`); sending USDC straight to it does not work.
- **The deposit wallet is invisible in the Polymarket UI.** It's a different
  address from your Polymarket login, so the UI shows neither its balance nor
  its positions. Use `npm run cross-market-mm:status` (and the on-chain links it
  prints) to see them.
- **Existing Gnosis Safe users:** Polymarket's CLOB **rejects orders from a
  Safe maker** ("maker address not allowed, please use the deposit wallet
  flow"). Auth and balance reads succeed from a Safe, but orders don't — so even
  Safe users must move to the deposit-wallet flow (sig type 3) for this bot.

### Two API tokens (not on-chain keys)

| Token | For | Where from |
|---|---|---|
| **Limitless HMAC token** (`LMTS_TOKEN_ID` + `LMTS_TOKEN_SECRET`) | scoped, signs every Limitless request | UI: connect wallet → API token modal → *API Tokens* → Derive |
| **Polymarket relayer key** (`RELAYER_API_KEY` + `RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS`) | gasless deposit-wallet deploy + approvals | Polymarket builder dashboard → relayer API key |

The Polymarket *trading* API key (used to place hedge orders) is **derived from
your `PRIVATE_KEY` signature at boot** — you don't create or store it. The
relayer key above is only for the one-time setup (deploy + approvals), which the
relayer pays gas for.

### The wiring order

```
setup-poly  →  fund  →  approve  →  preflight  →  run
```

1. **setup-poly** — derive + deploy the deposit wallet, approve pUSD (buy side)
   and CTF (sell side) on Polymarket's v2 exchanges.
2. **fund** — Base USDC + a little ETH on the EOA (sent directly); USDC to the
   Polymarket **bridge** (`cross-market-mm:deposit`) for the deposit wallet's pUSD —
   you cannot send pUSD to the deposit wallet directly (see §4.3).
3. **approve** — Limitless exchange approval for your pair's market(s).
4. **preflight** — one command that re-checks all of the above and the pair.
5. **run** — dry-run, then live.

`npm run cross-market-mm:init` is the guided version of steps 1–2: it runs
setup-poly, scaffolds `.env` + config, and prints the funding addresses. You
still do step 3 (**approve**) and pick + verify a pair yourself.

---

## 3. Commands

All from the repo root (`agents-starter/`). One-time setup commands are marked.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run cross-market-mm:init` | **(guided setup)** Re-runnable bootstrap: scaffolds `.env` + config, checks credentials, deploys the deposit wallet and writes its address into the config, then prints the exact addresses to fund. Run it, do the step it asks for, run it again |
| `npm run cross-market-mm:find-pairs` | Scan both venues; print a liquidity-ranked shortlist of equivalent market pairs as paste-ready YAML. Flags polarity-flipped (negation/direction) candidates |
| `npm run cross-market-mm:setup-poly` | **(one-time)** Derive + deploy your Polymarket deposit wallet; approve pUSD (buy) + CTF (sell) on both v2 exchanges |
| `npm run cross-market-mm:deposit` | Print the Polymarket **bridge address** to fund the deposit wallet — send USDC there (Base/Polygon/…) and it auto-wraps to pUSD. Sending USDC straight to the deposit wallet does NOT work |
| `npm run cross-market-mm:preflight` | Validate auth, funding, sig type, exchange approvals, and pair resolution on both venues. Exits non-zero on any critical failure — use as a gate |
| `npm run cross-market-mm` | Run the bot (DRY_RUN by default). `DRY_RUN=false` to go live |
| `npm run cross-market-mm:status` | Read-only cross-venue portfolio view: Limitless USDC + positions/orders, deposit-wallet pUSD + positions, and per-pair net delta |
| `npm run cross-market-mm:close` | **Exit to flat:** cancel resting Limitless orders, then SELL held inventory on BOTH venues back to flat |
| `npm run cross-market-mm:flatten` | Cancel resting Limitless orders only (does not touch positions). Lighter recovery tool |
| `npm run cross-market-mm:analyze` | Summarize the latest run's JSONL log (orders, fills, how flat the book stayed, hedges fired) |
| `npm start approve <slug>` | **(one-time, per exchange)** Approve a Limitless market's exchange for USDC (buy) + CTF (sell) |

---

## 4. Setup

> **Two ways through this.** `npm run cross-market-mm:init` is the guided path —
> re-runnable, it walks 4.1–4.3 (credentials → deposit wallet → funding) and
> scaffolds your config. The steps below are exactly what it does, plus the
> manual path if you'd rather run each command yourself. **Either way, init does
> not pick a pair or approve the exchange for you** — you still do §4.4 (find +
> verify a pair) and §4.5 (approve) before going live.

### 4.1 Install + secrets

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env && chmod 600 .env
```

Set in `.env`:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...                 # dedicated trading EOA (NOT your main wallet)
LMTS_TOKEN_ID=...                 # Limitless scoped HMAC token id
LMTS_TOKEN_SECRET=...             # Limitless scoped HMAC token secret (base64)
RELAYER_API_KEY=...               # Polymarket relayer key (for setup-poly)
RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS=0x...     # your signer EOA address (= PRIVATE_KEY's address)
DRY_RUN=true                      # keep true until you've watched a dry run
```

Get the **Limitless HMAC token** from the UI (the browser handles login, so you
never touch a Privy token and no smart wallet is involved):
limitless.exchange → connect wallet → API token modal → *API Tokens* tab →
Derive → copy `tokenId` + `secret`. Headless/CI: `npm run derive-token`.

Get the **relayer key** from the Polymarket builder dashboard.

### 4.2 Polymarket deposit wallet (one command)

```bash
npm run cross-market-mm:setup-poly
```

This is gasless (the relayer pays). It:
1. derives your deposit-wallet address,
2. deploys it via the relayer if it isn't already deployed,
3. approves **pUSD** (ERC-20 `approve`, the BUY side) AND **CTF**
   (`setApprovalForAll`, the SELL side) for Polymarket's v2 exchanges
   (`exchangeV2`, `negRiskExchangeV2`, `negRiskAdapter`).

Both approvals matter: pUSD-approve lets you place hedge BUYs, CTF-approve lets
`cross-market-mm:close` SELL the inventory back to flat. Skipping the CTF approval is
why an early close attempt left a naked Polymarket leg — the sell reverted with
allowance 0. setup-poly now does both and skips any already set.

It prints the deposit-wallet address. Put it in your config:

```yaml
poly_funder: "0x...the printed deposit-wallet address"
poly_signature_type: 3
```

### 4.3 Fund

Two sides. The **Limitless** side you fund by sending to your EOA **directly**.
The **Polymarket** side you fund **through a bridge** — you *cannot* get pUSD into
the deposit wallet by sending to it directly.

| Side | Send | On | To | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Limitless collateral | USDC | Base (8453) | **your EOA** (directly) | collateral for resting limit orders |
| Limitless gas | ETH (~$1–2) | Base | **your EOA** (directly) | gas for one-time approvals |
| Polymarket hedge | **USDC** | Base / Polygon / Ethereum | **the bridge** (NOT the deposit wallet) | auto-wraps to pUSD in the deposit wallet |

For the hedge side, run:

```bash
npm run cross-market-mm:deposit
```

It prints the **bridge address** + the minimum. Send **USDC** there (any supported
chain — same address) and it auto-wraps to **pUSD** and credits your deposit
wallet. Send a small test first, confirm with `cross-market-mm:status`, then the rest.

> ⚠ Do **NOT** send USDC straight to the deposit-wallet address (it won't
> auto-wrap there), and do **NOT** use the Polymarket app's deposit button — both
> strand your funds (the
> app button credits a *different* account). Only the bridge address from
> `cross-market-mm:deposit` produces spendable pUSD. Your EOA on Base (USDC + ETH) is
> the only thing you send to an address directly. No Polygon gas (MATIC/POL) is
> ever needed — Polymarket deploy + approvals are gasless via the relayer.

### 4.4 Configure the pair

```bash
npm run cross-market-mm:find-pairs          # prints paste-ready YAML
cp src/strategies/cross-market-mm/config.example.yaml ./cross-market-mm.config.yaml
```

Edit `cross-market-mm.config.yaml`: paste a verified pair into `market_pairs`, set
`order_size` small (start at `5`), confirm `poly_funder` + `poly_signature_type:
3`. **Verify both markets resolve on identical criteria** — same asset,
threshold, UTC moment, source. Title overlap is not enough (see §8).

### 4.5 Approve the Limitless exchange (one-time, per exchange)

```bash
npm start approve <your-limitless-slug>
```

Sends USDC→exchange (buy) and CTF→exchange (sell) approvals on Base. **Neg-risk
markets** (sports/election "winner" markets) use a *separate* exchange contract,
so a neg-risk pair needs its own approve. Preflight tells you if it's missing.

### 4.6 Preflight

```bash
npm run cross-market-mm:preflight
```

Re-checks Limitless HMAC auth + Base USDC, Polymarket auth + sig type +
deposit-wallet pUSD, the circuit-breaker setting, per-exchange USDC allowance on
Base, that the funder is API-tradeable (fails fast if it's a Gnosis Safe), and
that every configured pair resolves on both venues. Non-zero exit = don't go
live yet. `npm run cross-market-mm:preflight && npm run cross-market-mm` is the safe gate.

---

## 5. Dry run

```bash
npm run cross-market-mm          # DRY_RUN is the default
```

DRY_RUN signs and sends nothing: cancel/place/hedge each short-circuit to a
`[DRY_RUN] would …` log line, the Polymarket CLOB auth derivation is skipped,
and the hedger skips the authed Limitless position read. But all *reads*
(markets, Polymarket positions, WS book) still happen — your config is validated
end-to-end. A healthy boot resolves both markets, connects the Poly WS, and
fires a cancel-replace cycle within ~5s of `Poly WS connected`. If it doesn't,
the Poly book isn't quoting or your slug is wrong (see §7).

### See the hedge fire without a live taker

Illiquid Limitless markets may not fill for a long time. To watch the full
fill→hedge round-trip through the real pipeline (no real money):

```bash
SIMULATE_FILL=YES:5 DRY_RUN=true npm run cross-market-mm   # Ctrl-C, then:
npm run cross-market-mm:analyze
```

It injects a synthetic 5-share YES fill on the first pair; the real hedger
detects the exposure and fires the offsetting NO hedge on Polymarket (logged in
dry-run), returning the book to delta-flat. This is the demo of cross-venue
market-making that needs no Polymarket funding.

---

## 6. Go live and operate

```bash
# set dry_run: false in YAML AND ensure DRY_RUN isn't true in .env, then:
npm run cross-market-mm
```

Boot runs both auth probes before quoting, so a wrong sig type / funder / token
fails in ~2s instead of after fills accumulate. Every live start also cancels
any orders a prior run left resting, so the book starts flat.

**Monitor:**

```bash
npm run cross-market-mm:status      # cross-venue portfolio + net delta any time
```

`status` is the only place to see the deposit wallet's pUSD + Polymarket
positions (the UI can't show them) and the per-pair net delta (≈0 = hedged).

### Safety rails (built in)

- **Loss circuit-breaker** (`max_loss_usd`, default $10): marks equity (pUSD +
  Base USDC + position value) each tick; on a drawdown past the limit it aborts
  the run. **Resilient to bad reads** (hardened after a Jun-12 false trip): a
  tick whose pUSD *or* Base USDC read fails is SKIPPED (a partial read can no
  longer fake a drawdown), and the breaker trips only after **3 consecutive**
  valid sub-threshold ticks, so a single transient bad mark cannot trip it.
- **Inventory guard** (`max_net_shares`, default 4× `order_size`;
  `max_hedge_failures`, default 3): the lighter, earlier-firing sibling of the
  loss breaker. When net exposure on a pair reaches `max_net_shares`, OR a
  pair's hedge fails `max_hedge_failures` times in a row (the Poly route went
  thin/closed), the bot **pulls quotes** — writes `pull.flag`, so the quoter
  stops adding inventory while the hedger keeps flattening. This is what was
  missing on Jun-12, when failing hedges let net pile to 100 unhedged. **Sticky:**
  you (or the panel/Telegram resume button) clear `pull.flag` after inspecting
  *why* hedging stalled, so a broken venue route can't silently resume into the
  same pileup. Set either knob to `0` to disable.
- **Flatten on stop** (`flatten_on_stop`, default **true**): a stop — Ctrl-C OR
  a tripped breaker — first cancels all resting orders, then **sells inventory
  to flat on BOTH venues**, so a stop never walks away with unhedged directional
  inventory. Cancelling orders alone isn't enough: a fill that already hedged
  leaves a position on each venue. Set `flatten_on_stop: false` only if you
  deliberately want to leave inventory in place.
- **Boot-clean:** every live start cancels prior resting orders before quoting.

> **`pull.flag` vs `kill.flag`.** `pull.flag` = stop quoting, keep hedging
> (recoverable: clear it to resume). `kill.flag` = full halt + flatten
> (a tripped breaker writes it; it persists across restarts so a tripped bot
> stays down until you clear it). The panel and Telegram buttons, the breaker,
> and the inventory guard all write these same two files — one control path.

### Manual exit to flat

```bash
npm run cross-market-mm:close
```

The deliberate wind-down. Per pair it cancels resting Limitless orders, then
SELLS held YES/NO inventory back to flat on **both** venues (Limitless: FAK at
bid − slippage; Polymarket: market FAK), and verifies 0 positions / 0 orphan
orders on both. It uses settled re-reads with a settle delay between sells so a
lagged balance can't trigger a re-sell of what already sold (the stale-read
double-fill bug). Idempotent — re-run if a thin book leaves a remainder.

`cross-market-mm:flatten` is the lighter tool: it only cancels resting orders and
does not touch positions. Use it when a run was killed ungracefully and you just
want a clean book.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

### `Polymarket auth probe failed` / "maker address not allowed"
Wrong `poly_signature_type`, or `poly_funder` isn't the deposit wallet. The CLOB
**rejects Gnosis Safe makers** — even existing Safe users must use the
deposit-wallet flow. Run `npm run cross-market-mm:setup-poly`, set the printed address
as `poly_funder` with `poly_signature_type: 3`.

### Hedge BUY works but `cross-market-mm:close` SELL reverts ("not enough balance / allowance ... allowance 0")
Selling outcome tokens on Polymarket needs the **CTF `setApprovalForAll`**
(token side), which is distinct from the pUSD `approve` (cash side). Re-run
`npm run cross-market-mm:setup-poly` — it sets both. (This left a naked Poly leg once
this session; the fix is the CTF approval, then re-run close.)

### "isApprovedForAll returned no data (0x)" during setup-poly
A wrong CTF address — e.g. `0x69308FB512518e39F9b16112fA8d994F4e2Bf8bB` is the
**Amoy testnet** ConditionalTokens, not Polygon mainnet. The correct Polygon CTF
is `0x4D97DCd97eC945f40cF65F87097ACe5EA0476045` (already set in setup-poly).

### My pUSD / positions don't show up; CLOB says "insufficient balance"
pUSD must be **in the deposit wallet**, not your EOA / Safe / UI login address.
And only `@polymarket/clob-client-v2` trades pUSD — the old v1 client silently
fails against a pUSD-funded account. Run `npm run cross-market-mm:status` to see the
deposit wallet's actual pUSD balance and the polygonscan/data-api links.

### `Invalid or revoked API key` / `401` (Limitless)
Get/refresh the scoped HMAC token from the UI (API token modal → *API Tokens* →
Derive) into `LMTS_TOKEN_ID` + `LMTS_TOKEN_SECRET`. If you're on a legacy
`LIMITLESS_API_KEY`, note Limitless keeps **one active key per account** —
generating a new one in the UI silently revokes the old. Switch to an HMAC token
to avoid this. In DRY_RUN this only surfaces when polling positions (the hedger
skips that call in dry-run); live boot hits it when the SDK fetches your profile.

### `Market not approved` at first live `createOrder`
Each Limitless market needs a one-time USDC + CTF approval; the bot doesn't
auto-approve. Run `npm start approve <limitless-slug>`, then relaunch. Neg-risk
markets use a separate exchange and need their own approve.

### Close looks like it sold but the position is still there next read
Backend reads lag a fill. `cross-market-mm:close` already guards this with settled
re-reads + a settle delay; if you wrote a custom exit, re-read the *settled*
position before acting again, or a lagged read makes a filled order look killed
and you double-sell.

### The hedger fired multiple times for one fill (over-hedged, then corrected)
Same lagged-read root cause, on the hedge side: the Polymarket data-api position
read trails a hedge by several seconds, so if `hedge_interval` is shorter than
that lag, the next tick re-reads the pre-hedge position and fires the same hedge
again — over-shooting, then buying the other side to correct. The
`hedge_settle_ms` gate (default 12s) suppresses re-hedging a pair until its read
can reflect the prior hedge. Keep `hedge_settle_ms` > your observed data-api
lag. (Seen live: one 4.9-share fill drew 3 hedges, ~$8.4 of Poly buys for a
~$3.4 need; net still ended flat, but it over-traded. The gate fixes it.)

### Quotes rest forever, no fills
Either the pair is illiquid on Limitless (no takers hitting your book — pick a
higher-volume pair) or `margin_bps` is too wide and your quotes are off-touch
(tighten it). Remember you need liquidity on **both** venues at once (§8).
"Winner"/futures markets (championship, election) have deep books but little
minute-to-minute taker flow — your quote can sit at the touch for hours.
Higher-churn markets (actively-traded sports/crypto near an event) fill faster.

### Many `place_order failed` with `429` / "Too Many Requests" (Cloudflare 1015)
The Limitless API is IP-rate-limiting you. Cancel-replace fires every Polymarket
tick, and the Poly book ticks several times/sec, so an unthrottled run —
especially across multiple pairs — sends enough cancel+place calls to trip
Cloudflare. Symptoms: `place_order failed` count climbs, ticks log `replicate
tick failed`, quotes stop refreshing reliably (and a fill during a 429 window
could go un-hedged). The fix is the `min_requote_ms` floor (default 2000ms/pair)
— it coalesces bursts to one cancel-replace per interval while still quoting the
freshest book. Raise it or run fewer pairs if you still see 429s; lower it only
for a single pair you've confirmed stays under the limit. (Found the hard way on
a sustained 3-pair live run: ~7k orders in under 2h tripped the limit.)

### `place_order failed: Post-only order would execute immediately`
Your computed BUY price crosses the Limitless book (your bid ≥ the best ask), so
the post-only (maker) order is refused rather than taking. It means the two
venues are mispriced for that market — your Poly-derived quote is *through* the
Limitless touch. Harmless (the bot keeps quoting the other pairs); that pair just
won't rest a maker order until the books re-converge. It's also a signal the
cross-venue spread is inverted there — interesting, but the maker-only strategy
(invariant §9.1) won't take it.

### `404` on Polymarket asset resolution
`polymarket_slug` is wrong. Polymarket has *event* slugs and *market* slugs; the
bot wants the **market** slug (one binary outcome). `find-pairs` prints the right
one.

### `Market not found for slug: …`
The slug doesn't exist on that venue. Re-run `find-pairs` and re-paste.

---

## 8. Picking a pair

There's no magic matcher — finding equivalent markets is a manual judgment call,
and `find-pairs` only does the first-pass ranking (it gates on a live, balanced
Polymarket book + Limitless volume). **The real constraint: the pair must be
liquid on *both* venues at once** — you need Limitless *takers* to fill your
maker quotes, and a Polymarket book to hedge into.

Categories that overlap most reliably:

- **Crypto price markets** ("Up or Down" / "above $X by <date>"). Identical
  underlying, so closest to truly equivalent — but confirm the **same window**
  (hourly vs 15-min), same reference price/oracle, same resolution instant. A 1h
  Limitless market and a 15-min Polymarket market on the same coin are *not* the
  same trade.
- **Recurring macro/economic** (Fed decisions, CPI). Listed on both around the
  event, resolve on the same public number.
- **Sports finals, elections, tournament winners** (UCL/NBA/NHL champions,
  presidential/nomination winners). The deepest, most balanced overlap. These
  are grouped/**neg-risk** markets — each candidate is its own YES/NO sub-market;
  `find-pairs` enumerates them. Confirm the exact candidate matches on both sides.

Two traps the matcher won't catch: a **prop vs the winner** ("reach
final"/"top scorer" ≠ "win"), and the **right market with the wrong entity**
("Italy to win" paired with "Spain to win"). Read both resolution criteria in
full before trusting a match.

---

### 8.1 Continual market-experiment loop

Treat each new market set as an experiment, not just a config edit. The durable
loop is:

```text
discover candidates
→ manually verify equivalence
→ patch config as an experiment snapshot
→ clean-book gate
→ test/build/preflight/status gate
→ tracked live run
→ analyze JSONL/status evidence
→ convert friction into tests/config guards/status fields/watchdogs/runbook notes
→ repeat with new markets resiliently
```

Use this loop when rotating markets:

1. **Capture the hypothesis:** why these markets should work — high taker flow,
   reward eligibility, clean equivalence, balanced books, upcoming catalyst, or
   a controlled safety test.
2. **Discover candidates:** run `cross-market-mm:find-pairs`; prefer short-window
   crypto / active event markets when the goal is fill velocity; start with 1–3
   pairs to limit cancel/replace pressure.
3. **Verify equivalence manually:** same entity, threshold/window, resolution
   source, polarity, and cancellation/fallback logic. Title similarity is not
   enough.
4. **Patch config as a snapshot:** selected slugs, order size, hedge threshold,
   margin, loss cap, and rationale. Size orders so a full-fill hedge clears the
   Polymarket minimum notional on both possible fill sides.
5. **Clean-book gate:** stop/close the current run deliberately, then verify zero
   live orders and acceptable inventory across configured and stale/orphan
   markets before restarting.
6. **Preflight gate:** `npm test`, `npm run build`,
   `npm run cross-market-mm:preflight`, and `npm run cross-market-mm:status`.
   Do not restart live until all pass.
7. **Run with telemetry:** tracked process, boot-clean confirmation, auth OK,
   resolved markets, WS connected, orders placed, watchdog/pinned status enabled.
8. **Analyze and compound:** run `cross-market-mm:analyze`, inspect JSONL for
   fills/hedges/`hedge_skip`/order failures, then convert every friction into a
   guard, test, status field, alert, code patch, or runbook note.

The strategy should be able to rotate into new markets resiliently without
hidden operator folklore.

## 9. Capital math, economics, and invariants

### Capital locked

Each pair keeps two resting Limitless orders (YES BUY + NO BUY). Combined locked
capital ≈ `order_size × 1` USDC (the two prices sum to ~$1). So `order_size: 5`
≈ $5 locked per pair; `order_size: 100` ≈ $100.

**Asymmetric markets** (e.g. ~6% YES / ~93% NO) split lopsidedly — the NO BUY
alone can lock ~93% of capital. Size down or pick a balanced market.

### Economics

**On Limitless you are the maker, and makers pay no fee.** Limitless charges
fees on takers only (limit orders that rest on the book are free — see
[docs.limitless.exchange/user-guide/fees](https://docs.limitless.exchange/user-guide/fees)).
The cross-market-mm quotes `postOnly`, so every Limitless fill is a maker fill at
zero fee. Your only direct cost is the **Polymarket FAK hedge**, which is a
taker order on Polymarket and pays whatever Polymarket's current taker fee is
for that market — verify it against Polymarket's live schedule rather than
assuming a number.

So the per-round-trip ledger is:

```
Revenue:
  + cross-venue spread   the margin you quote inside the Poly book, captured
                         when both legs fill (locks 1 − P_yes − Q_no at resolution)
  + maker rebate         in eligible markets (see below) — fill-gated
  + LP rewards           for qualifying resting size near midpoint — quote-presence
Costs:
  − Polymarket hedge     the FAK taker fee on the hedge leg (per Poly's schedule)
  − adverse selection    you tend to get filled when the price is moving against you;
                         cross-venue divergence between quote and hedge is real slippage
```

There's no Limitless fee term and no fee "tier" — Limitless fees are dynamic by
price + a loyalty discount, but they apply to *takers*, so they don't touch a
maker bot. The real levers are the two reward programs and pair selection, not a
tier upgrade.

### Earning the reward programs (this is where the money is)

Two separate, stackable Limitless programs reward exactly what this bot does —
provide maker liquidity. Both pay daily in USDC.

- **[Maker rebates](https://docs.limitless.exchange/user-guide/maker-rebates):**
  when a taker hits your resting order and pays a taker fee, a share of that fee
  is rebated to makers, pro-rata, daily. **Only executed fills earn** — resting
  unfilled orders earn nothing here. As of this writing the rebate rate is
  **100% of eligible taker fees** on **Daily, Hourly Crypto, and 15-minute
  Crypto** markets (current program config — may change; check the page).
- **[LP rewards](https://docs.limitless.exchange/user-guide/lp-rewards):** daily
  USDC for limit orders resting **within a spread of the midpoint** and **above
  a per-market minimum size** — paid for quote *presence*, not fills. Closer to
  mid + more size = larger share.

Two consequences for how you run this:

1. **Size to qualify.** `order_size: 5` is a smoke-test size. LP rewards have a
   per-market minimum-shares threshold (often ~100); below it you earn nothing
   from LP rewards and little rebate credit. To actually farm rewards, quote
   larger size within the reward spread of midpoint.
2. **Target eligible + cross-venue-liquid markets.** Short-window crypto
   (Hourly / 15-minute) is both at 100% rebate *and* the cleanest cross-venue
   match — the sweet spot. Far-dated winner futures are eligible-uncertain and
   have thin taker flow (so few fills → little rebate).

The dual-purpose use is **volume farming**: every hedge is a Polymarket taker
order (~$1 Poly volume per $1 Limitless fill), so the hedge cost doubles as the
entry ticket for Polymarket points/airdrop eligibility.

> [!NOTE]
> The binding constraint on profit is **fill rate**, not fees. Rebates and LP
> rewards only pay when your maker liquidity is actually used, which needs
> eligible markets with real taker flow on both venues. Validated live, this is
> the hard part — not the unit economics.

### Strategy invariants (load-bearing — re-derive the math before changing)

1. **Both Limitless quotes are BUY.** YES BUY at `poly_bid − margin`, NO BUY at
   `(1 − poly_ask) − margin`. Never SELL on Limitless while quoting.
2. **Cancel-all + replace every tick.** No diff optimizer; cancel+replace is
   cheaper than divergence risk.
3. **Hedge always BUYs on Polymarket.** Too much YES → BUY NO; too much NO → BUY
   YES.
4. **YES-frame is canonical** downstream of the WS listener (NO updates are
   inverted to `YES_ask = 1 − NO_bid`).

## 10. Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Unit tests cover the quote math (`clipPrice`, `computeBuyPrices`), the hedger
(`decideHedge` direction, notional, dust gate, cross-venue netting), the
recorder, and the risk monitor.
